  <p>
    I'm in my second year of studying Computer Science at McMaster University. I'm super passionate about coding and have experience in backend, frontend, and hardware. I love tackling challenging problems, bringing my creative ideas to life, and expanding my skills.

When I’m not immersed in school assignments, you’ll often find me:
- 👩🏽‍💻 Working on personal projects
- 🎨 Lost in a painting session
- 📚 Buried in the pages of a good novel
